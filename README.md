# This is the general readme file for the accompanying software for Ranasinghe et al., Nat Commun 2018, “Detecting RNA base methylations in single cells by *in situ* hybridization”

# Purpose of the software:
Calculation of intensities for two- or three-colour fluorescence *in situ* hybridisation (FISH) experiments using wide-field images of individual, stained bacteria. The program also produces several analytical plots and calculates the logarithm of the intensity ratio between two colours (red/green for two-colour experiments and yellow/green for three-colour experiments).

# Using this software:
You can find the MATLAB code in this repository, the code is commented and accompanied by read-me files. If you end up using a (modified) version of our code for your academic work, please cite our original publication!
