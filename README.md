# This is the general readme file for the accompanying software for Ranasinghe et al., Nat Commun 2018, “Detecting RNA base methylations in single cells by *in situ* hybridization”

# Purpose of the software:
Calculation of intensities for two- or three-colour fluorescence *in situ* hybridisation (FISH) experiments using wide-field images of individual, stained bacteria. The program also produces several analytical plots and calculates the logarithm of the intensity ratio between two colours (red/green for two-colour experiments and yellow/green for three-colour experiments). In case of questions, email Kristina Ganzinger (ganzinger AT biochem DOT mpg DOT de) or get in touch by [raising an issue](https://github.com/kganzinger/Analysis-Software-for-in-situ-hybridization-data-in-single-cells/issues).
