# This is the general readme file for the accompanying software for Ranasinghe et al., Nat Commun 2018, “Detecting RNA base methylations in single cells by in situ hybridization”

# Purpose of the software:
Calculation of intensities for two- or three-colour FISH experiments using wide-field images of single labelled bacteria. The program also produces several analytical plots and calculates the logarithm of the intensity ratio between two colours (r/b for two colour experiments and y/b for three colour experiments). In case of questions, email Kristina Ganzinger (ganzinger AT biochem.mpg.de) or get in touch by [raising an issue](https://github.com/kganzinger/Analysis-Software-for-in-situ-hybridization-data-in-single-cells/issues).
