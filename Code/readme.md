The code deposited under /Versions-used-for-analysis-in-Ranasinghe-et-al is the version used in the paper Ranasinghe et al., Nat Commun 2018, “Detecting RNA base methylations in single cells by in situ hybridization”.

The code deposited under /latest-version is a modified version of this code that can analyse two and three-colour data and, unlike the original code, handle different image sizes. This should improve user friendliness. Unlike the original version, I will keep updating the code in this directory.
